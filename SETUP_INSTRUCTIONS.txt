PADDLE PAYMENT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==================================

✅ COMPLETED:
- Frontend integration with Paddle checkout
- Download page with transaction verification UI
- Route setup for /download page
- Paddle IDs configured in PluginPage.tsx

📋 NEXT STEPS - Backend API Setup:

1. DEPLOY BACKEND API ENDPOINTS
   
   You need to deploy two API endpoints:
   - /api/verify-transaction
   - /api/download
   
   Example files are in: /api/verify-transaction.js and /api/download.js

2. DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:

   Option A: Vercel (Recommended - Easiest)
   - Copy /api/verify-transaction.js to your project
   - Copy /api/download.js to your project
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - API routes will work automatically

   Option B: Netlify Functions
   - Copy functions to /netlify/functions/
   - Update export format (see comments in files)
   - Deploy to Netlify

   Option C: Express.js Server
   - Create Express.js server
   - Add routes from the example files
   - Deploy to your hosting

3. CONFIGURE FILE DELIVERY:

   Option 1: Use Paddle's Built-in Delivery (Easiest)
   - Upload ZIP file in Paddle dashboard
   - Paddle automatically emails download links
   - No backend needed for file delivery
   - Update DownloadPage to show "Check your email" message

   Option 2: Your Own Server/CDN
   - Upload plugin ZIP to your server or CDN
   - Update PLUGIN_FILE_PATH in /api/download.js
   - Backend serves file after verification

4. TEST THE FLOW:

   1. Click "Buy Pro Version" on plugin page
   2. Complete test purchase in Paddle
   3. Should redirect to /download?transaction=xxx
   4. Download page verifies transaction
   5. Shows download button
   6. User downloads plugin

5. SECURITY NOTES:

   - API key is in backend files - keep them secure
   - Never expose API key in frontend code
   - Use environment variables in production
   - Verify transactions server-side only
   - Consider rate limiting on download endpoint

6. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (Production):

   Create .env file or set in hosting:
   PADDLE_API_KEY=REMOVED_API_KEY
   PLUGIN_FILE_URL=https://your-cdn.com/plugin.zip

7. QUICK START (If using Paddle's file delivery):

   - Upload plugin ZIP in Paddle dashboard
   - Customers get download link via email automatically
   - Download page can just show success message
   - No backend file serving needed

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Frontend ready
⏳ Backend API needs deployment
⏳ File delivery needs configuration
