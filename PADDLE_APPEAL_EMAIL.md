# Paddle Domain Approval Appeal Email

**Subject:** Appeal: Domain Approval Request for shalconnects.com - Software Product Sales

---

Hi Danny,

Thank you for your email regarding the domain approval for shalconnects.com. I understand your team's concerns and would like to provide clarification about our business model and the specific product we intend to sell through Paddle.

## Clarification of Our Business Model

I believe there may be a misunderstanding about what we're selling through Paddle. While shalconnects.com does offer digital agency services (web development, design, etc.), **we are seeking Paddle approval specifically to sell a standalone software product** - not services.

### The Product We're Selling Through Paddle:

**WooCommerce Variation Images Pro** - This is a **premium WordPress plugin** (software product) that we have developed. It is:

- ✅ A **digital software product** (ZIP file download)
- ✅ A **standalone WordPress plugin** for WooCommerce
- ✅ **Not a service** - customers receive the plugin file immediately after purchase
- ✅ Similar to other WordPress plugins sold through Paddle (like WooCommerce extensions)

**Product Page:** https://shalconnects.com/services/wordpress/plugins/variation-images-pro

### What Customers Receive:

- Plugin ZIP file (immediate digital download)
- Installation documentation
- License key for updates
- Technical support for the plugin

This is a **software product sale**, not a service offering.

## Addressing the "Human Services" Concern

I understand Paddle's Acceptable Use Policy prohibits "Human services which are not related to a software offering." 

**To clarify:**
- The **plugin product** we're selling through Paddle is a **software product**, not a service
- Our agency services (web development, design) are **separate offerings** and are **not** being sold through Paddle
- We are **only** using Paddle to process payments for the **software plugin product**

The plugin is a complete, downloadable software product that customers install on their WordPress sites - similar to how other WordPress plugin developers use Paddle.

## Our Commitment to Compliance

We are committed to full compliance with Paddle's Acceptable Use Policy and Terms & Conditions. If there are any specific changes needed to our website or product presentation to meet Paddle's requirements, we are happy to make them.

**Possible Solutions We're Open To:**

1. **Separate Subdomain:** We can create a dedicated subdomain (e.g., `store.shalconnects.com` or `plugins.shalconnects.com`) exclusively for plugin sales, with all service offerings removed from that subdomain.

2. **Website Updates:** We can update our website to more clearly separate the software product sales from service offerings.

3. **Additional Documentation:** We can provide any additional information or documentation needed to clarify our business model.

## Product Information

**Product Name:** WooCommerce Variation Images Pro  
**Product Type:** WordPress Plugin (Software)  
**Delivery Method:** Digital download (ZIP file)  
**Price:** $24.99  
**Product Page:** https://shalconnects.com/services/wordpress/plugins/variation-images-pro

## Request

I respectfully request that you reconsider our domain approval, as we are selling a legitimate software product (WordPress plugin) that aligns with Paddle's intended use case for software companies. The plugin is a complete, downloadable software product - not a service.

If you have any questions or need additional information, I'm happy to provide:
- Screenshots of the product
- Product documentation
- Clarification on any aspect of our business model
- Any other information needed for review

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Shalauddin
