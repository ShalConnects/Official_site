# Paddle Domain Approval Response - Addressing All Issues

**Subject:** Re: Domain Verification - store.shalconnects.com - Issues Addressed

---

Hi there,

Thank you for reviewing my domain submission for store.shalconnects.com. I have addressed all three issues you raised. Please find the details below:

---

## 1. Legal Business Name - Update in Progress

**Current Situation:**
- My Paddle merchant account is currently registered under "Balanze" (this was a mistake during initial registration - I used one of my SaaS product names instead of my legal name)
- My Terms & Conditions correctly show: "Shalauddin Kader (trading as ShalConnects)"
- My actual legal name is: **Shalauddin Kader**

**Action Taken:**
I am in the process of updating my Paddle merchant account information to reflect my correct legal name: **Shalauddin Kader (trading as ShalConnects)**. I have contacted Paddle support to update my account details.

**Current Terms & Conditions:**
The Terms & Conditions page at https://store.shalconnects.com/terms correctly shows:
- **Vendor:** Shalauddin Kader (trading as ShalConnects)
- This matches my actual legal business name

**Next Steps:**
Once Paddle support updates my merchant account name from "Balanze" to "Shalauddin Kader (trading as ShalConnects)", the names will match perfectly. I will notify you once this update is complete.

## 2. Refund Policy - Qualifiers Removed ✅

**Issue:** The refund policy contained qualifiers and exceptions, which Paddle does not support.

**Action Taken:**
I have updated the refund policy to be completely unconditional. The new policy is now live at: https://store.shalconnects.com/refund

**Updated Refund Policy:**
- **30-Day Money-Back Guarantee** - Full refund within 30 days of purchase, **no questions asked**
- All qualifiers, exceptions, and conditions have been removed
- No "if" statements or conditional language
- Simple, straightforward policy that complies with Paddle's requirements

The policy now states: "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all WordPress plugins and themes. If you request a refund within 30 days of your purchase date, you will receive a full refund, no questions asked."
